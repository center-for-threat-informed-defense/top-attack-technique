            Top ATT&amp;CK Techniques provides defenders with a systematic approach
            to prioritizing ATT&amp;CK techniques. Our open methodology considers
            technique prevalence, common ATT&amp;CK choke points, and actionability
            to enable defenders to focus on the ATT&amp;CK techniques that are most
            relevant to their organization.
